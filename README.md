## Now the snake game is on 3DS!!!
I just made this homebrew to know more about how 3ds work, and for see how a real programming language is.

## What has?
What a normal snake game would have:
- [x] An amazing score system
- [x] A amazing snake
- [x] An inmersive experience with 60 fps of power
- [x] An amazing background music, chiptune based
- [x] Super minimalistic menu
- [x] More FX for pickups and when you die
- [x] A highscore system

## What I'm trying to do:
- [ ] Bug fixing
- [ ] You can give me more ideas

## Libraries I used:

* m3diaLib from [m3diaLib-Team](https://github.com/m3diaLib-Team/m3diaLib-CTR) you should try it if you like to break things
* Citro2d (included in m3dialib)
* Citro3d (included in m3dialib)
* 3ds-mpg123 (for audio things)
* ctrulib (main C library for 3DS by Smea)
* And more things but I don't remember it
